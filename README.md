# Shelob

## Shelob fuzzer for OpenAPI specification

Shelob is a powerful tool designed to test and validate APIs that are defined using the OpenAPI specification. This tool helps identify potential vulnerabilities, security flaws, and unexpected behavior within your API endpoints by generating a variety of requests based on the OpenAPI schema.

## Features

* Automated Fuzzing: Shelob Fuzzer automates the process of generating and sending requests to your API endpoints based on the OpenAPI specification. This helps discover edge cases, security vulnerabilities, and potential data inconsistencies.

* Customizable Inputs: Configure the fuzzer to generate requests with a wide range of inputs, including valid and invalid data types, various data formats, and different parameter values. This allows you to thoroughly test your API's handling of different inputs.

* Authorization Methods: Shelob Fuzzer supports various authorization methods defined in your API's OpenAPI specification. Whether your API uses API keys, OAuth tokens, or other authentication mechanisms, the Shelob will include the required headers or tokens in its requests.

* Detailed Reports: After each fuzzing session, Shelob Fuzzer generates detailed reports containing information about the requests sent, the responses received, and any anomalies or errors encountered. This aids in debugging and improving the quality of your API.
